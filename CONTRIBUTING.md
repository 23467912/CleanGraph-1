## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it are governed by the [CleanGraph Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Getting Started

### Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs and features. Issue tracking is for problems with the software, not a place to ask how to use it. If you are having difficulty after looking over your configuration carefully, please post a question to [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/).

- If you find a bug, use the GitHub issues search feature to see if it has already been reported. If it has not, please open a new issue.
- If you have a feature request, it is wise to ensure that it aligns with the project goals. Please start by opening a new issue. Be sure to include a clear title and detailed description and be as transparent as possible.

### Pull Requests

We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Style Guides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

### Python Style Guide

All Python code must adhere to the [PEP 8 Style Guide](https://pep8.org) for Python Code.

### JavaScript Style Guide

All JavaScript must adhere to the [JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com).

## Additional Notes

### Issue and Pull Request Labels

This section lists the labels we use to help us track and manage issues and pull requests.

| Label name    | Description                                                                        |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bug`         | Confirmed issues or issues that are very likely bugs.                              |
| `enhancement` | Feature requests.                                                                  |
| `docs`        | Changes to documentation.                                                          |
| `duplicate`   | Issues which are duplicates of other issues, i.e., they have been reported before. |
| `question`    | Questions more than bug reports or feature requests (e.g. how do I do X).          |
