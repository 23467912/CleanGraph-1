# Code of Conduct

## 1. Overview

The purpose of this document is to establish expectations for behavior when participating in the CleanGraph community, as well as steps for reporting unacceptable behavior. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all. People violating this Code of Conduct may be banned from the community.

## 2. Our Community

CleanGraph is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

## 3. Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

- Participate in an authentic and active way.
- Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
- Attempt collaboration before conflict.
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
- Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants.

## 4. Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable:

- Violence, threats of violence, or violent language directed against another person.
- Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
- Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
- Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
- Inappropriate photography or recording.
- Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes sexualized comments or jokes, inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.

- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.

## 5. Reporting

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organiser as soon as possible by contacting `your_email@provider.com`. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

## 6. Enforcement

Violations of the Code of Conduct may be reported by following our reporting guidelines. All reports will be reviewed and investigated, and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

## 7. Attribution
