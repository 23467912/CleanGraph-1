Correcting errors in knowledge graphs constructed from textual data is a formidable challenge using conventional tools like spreadsheet software, and is even challenging with graph database software such as Neo4J. CleanGraph emerges as the solution to this issue by providing a platform designed for the efficient management of knowledge graphs, specifically those composed of semantic triples from text.

CleanGraph is a robust, open-source, full-stack application that combines intuitive graph visualisation capabilities with comprehensive management features including knowledge graph refinement and completion plugins. Its frontend is built with React.js, promising a seamless, user-friendly experience with a responsive interface. Meanwhile, the backend utilises FastAPI - a cutting-edge, high-performance Python web framework, ensuring rapid and reliable application performance. For data storage, CleanGraph relies on MongoDB, a NoSQL, document-based database system.

_Please note that CleanGraph is specifically designed for creating, reading, updating, and deleting graph elements, and it does not provide support for complex graph querying functionalities._

- **Intuitive Interface**: CleanGraph provides an easy-to-use graphical interface that lets users create, edit, review, and manage graphs with ease.
- **Multi-Platform**: Works on any system that supports Python and Node.js, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
