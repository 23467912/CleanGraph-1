CleanGraph is designed to address the formidable challenge of correcting errors in knowledge graphs constructed from textual dataâ€”a task that often proves difficult using conventional tools like spreadsheet software or even specialised graph database software such as Neo4J.

CleanGraph emerges as a solution by providing a robust, open-source, full-stack platform tailored for the efficient management of knowledge graphs, particularly those composed of semantic triples extracted from text.

It combines intuitive graph visualisation capabilities with comprehensive management features, including knowledge graph refinement and completion plugins. The frontend is built with React.js, offering a seamless, user-friendly experience with a responsive interface, while the backend relies on FastAPIâ€”a cutting-edge, high-performance Python web frameworkâ€”to ensure rapid and reliable performance. For data storage, CleanGraph employs MongoDB, a NoSQL, document-based database system.

_Please note: CleanGraph is specifically tailored for creating, reading, updating, and deleting graph elements, and does not provide support for complex graph querying functionalities._

## Features

- **Intuitive Interface**: CleanGraph provides an easy-to-use graphical interface that lets users create, edit, review, and manage graphs with ease.
- **Multi-Platform**: Works on any system that supports Python and Node.js, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. Works best in Google Chrome browser.
